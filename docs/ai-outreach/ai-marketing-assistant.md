## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

**Vague:**
> "How do I market better?"

**Specific:**
> "How should I market a B2B SaaS product to mid-market manufacturing companies?"

The more specific your question, the better the AI's guidance.

### 2. Provide Context

**Minimal Context:**
> "Write an email template"

**With Context:**
> "Write a cold outreach email template for our web development services, targeting e-commerce companies who need site speed optimization"

Include relevant details about your target audience, goals, and constraints.

### 3. Use RAG Context

Enable RAG context (📖) when asking about:
- Your products or services
- Your competitive positioning
- Your pricing and packaging
- Your target customers
- Your brand voice

Disable RAG for:
- General marketing concepts
- Industry best practices
- Theoretical frameworks
- Creative brainstorming

### 4. Iterate and Refine

The AI's first response is a starting point. Follow up with:
- "Can you make this more concise?"
- "What about [alternative approach]?"
- "Give me 3 more options for [specific element]"
- "How would this work for [specific scenario]?"

### 5. Combine with Human Judgment

The AI Marketing Assistant provides recommendations based on data and best practices, but:
- You know your business best
- Test suggestions before full implementation
- Adapt recommendations to your specific situation
- Measure results and iterate

- Use AI for ideation, human for selection
- Test creative elements with real audiences

### Strategic Context

- AI lacks real-world context about your market
- Combine AI insights with market research
- Validate recommendations with customer feedback

## Troubleshooting

### AI Responses Not Relevant

**Solutions:**
1. Enable RAG context toggle
